2.  Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
3.  Alternatively, serve it with a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or `python -m http.server`).

## Built with Antigravity

This project was built entirely by **Antigravity**, an advanced agentic AI coding assistant from Google Deepmind. This README.md is also generated by Antigravity too!

### Creation Process

1.  **Planning**: Antigravity analyzed the request for a "clean" and "simple" app and proposed a premium Glassmorphism design in an implementation plan.
2.  **Implementation**:
    -   Generated semantic HTML5 structure.
    -   Wrote custom CSS using variables and modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid) for the UI.
    -   Implemented Vanilla JavaScript for handling logic and DOM manipulation.
3.  **Verification**:
    -   Antigravity spawned a **Browser Subagent** to navigate the app, interact with elements (typing, clicking), and verify functionality automatically.
    -   Captured screenshots to prove the app's correctness.
4.  **Task Management**: Used an artifacts-based workflow to track progress, update task lists, and document the journey.
