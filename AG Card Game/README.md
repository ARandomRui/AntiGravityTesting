# Notes

Created using Google AntiGravity's Agent-Assisted mode.

Status: 
Unable to finish

Speculated issues: 
Antigravity have issues handling grab and drop or coordinates handling

Pros of Antigravity:
- Agent-assisted mode provides review before implementation, which is really nice as you can have a lookthrough before Antigravity starts to implement
- There's also browser extension where it can interact with the DOM elements which allows it to self debug website elements
