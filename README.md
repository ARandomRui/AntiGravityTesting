# Final Year Project Overview

This project explores the limits and opportunities of **vibe coding**, focusing on how modern AI coding agents handle creativity, ambiguity, and open-ended prompts.

Five projects were selected based on the recommended prompts from  
**Tom's Guide – “AI billionaires’ advice to teens: master vibe coding”**  
(https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/ai-billionaires-advice-to-teens-master-vibe-coding-heres-5-prompts-to-get-started).

In addition to these five guided projects, one self-designed project (AG Card Game) was created to test how **Antigravity** responds to more creative, less structured prompts. This allows evaluation of the system’s limitations, flexibility, and behavior when dealing with unconventional or imaginative project requests.
